# Student attendance tracker # 

## using Javascript and Firebase ## 

### This app tries to accomplish the following ### 

1. Keep track of students that are registered with the school. 
2. How much tuition each student pays each much. 
3. A dashboard that keeps track of overall expenses and revenue. 
4. Keeps a running total of the number of students. 
5. Very simple currency conversion. 

* Since this is just a simple demo app currently any user can just go to the page and play with the app. Obviously in a real world situation there would be signins and authentication. I feel that since this is just a demo app that potential employers wouldn't want to waste time registering. * 

### In the future I would like to add a more sophisitcated dashboard.  The currency converter also is very static. It currently converts the U.S dollar to won at a rate of 1,300 won to U.S dollar. This is an okay solution that can give a rough estimate of currency conversion, but it would be far better to have an api that can track real time currency conversions. But these days there is so much tech to learn and I feel like  I need to learn other things before coming back to this. Future me will have to make those improvements! ###
